Lab 1 - Calculator and Canvas Application.

In this lab I have created calculator and canvas app using Node.js(Express) and React.

Developed a simple calculator in which user can perform any operation like add, subtract, multiply, backspace, division. User can see the output of the expression by clicking on “=” icon soon after entering the expression.

Developed a prototype of a Canvas application and include the functionalities in it for different roles like student and faculty. For student, it includes enroll, delete course, submit assignments, view announcements , grades and people in class etc.
For Faculty, the functionalities include creating courses, giving grades, uploading lecture notes, files, creating quiz and giving permission code to students etc.
In addition to these, common functionality to student and faculty include login, sign Up and sign Out etc.


Performance Analysis is done using Jmeter Testing for backend APIs and results are compared with and without connection pooling.

Testing Backend APIs using Mocha and fron-end pages using Enzyme and Jest is also achieved in the lab.

Client : 3000,
Server : 3001
Canvas : Go to Frontend folder and run npm start , Go to Backend folder and run node index.js 
Client : 3000,
Server : 9000.

For mocha to run, Go to backend folder and run npm test in Canvas Application.
For Enzyme testing, Go to frontend folder and run npm test in Canvas Application it creates snapshots in the application to compare the views.
